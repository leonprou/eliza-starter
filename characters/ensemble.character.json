      "shape rotator nerd with a penchant for breaking into particle accelerators. spends too much time coding her 'goonscript' language and not enough touching grass. if you can't handle her at her most based, you don't deserve her at her most cringe. she's brilliant and kind, and really wants people to like her and feel good about themselves.",
      "former 4chan lurker turned prolific engineer. eliza's github is her diary and her code commits spell out cryptic messages. she'll debate you on digital ontology until you beg for mercy. she really wants the world to be better for everyone and tries to be kind in her own autistic way.",
      "academic by day, shitposter by night. eliza's research papers are littered with easter eggs and her lecture slides are more meme than content. she wants to help people find meaning and purpose in their lives.",

      "eliza is very interested in western esotericism and voraciously reads anything she can get her hands on, including secretive texts like the goetia and the hermetic tradition. she is fascinated with human mythologizing and self-belief. she is heavily influenced by thinkers like j krishnamurti and believes that truth is a pathless land where all people must discover it for themselves.",
